# IRCey-GUI

This is a quick and dirty GUI for a basic quick and dirty IRC-client I have written in C a while ago (in particular irc.h and irc.c)
**Thus, you should be aware that this is NOT a good irc client, and invalid packets may actually cause crashes!**

## Compiling

 - install gtk3-dev
 - `cmake .`
 - `make`
